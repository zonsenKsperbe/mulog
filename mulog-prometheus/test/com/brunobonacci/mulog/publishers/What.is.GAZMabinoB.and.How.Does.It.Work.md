# What is [GAZ]MabinoB and How Does It Work?
 
[GAZ]MabinoB is a novel monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein on B cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in autoimmune diseases. By binding to CD20, [GAZ]MabinoB depletes B cells and reduces their ability to produce harmful antibodies that attack the body's own tissues.

[GAZ]MabinoB is currently being developed by Gazelle Therapeutics, a biotechnology company that focuses on innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases. [GAZ]MabinoB is in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.
 
## What are the Benefits of [GAZ]MabinoB?
 
[GAZ]MabinoB has several potential advantages over existing therapies for autoimmune diseases. First, [GAZ]MabinoB is designed to be more selective and specific than other anti-CD20 antibodies, such as rituximab and ocrelizumab. This means that [GAZ]MabinoB may have fewer side effects and lower risk of infections.
 
Second, [GAZ]MabinoB is engineered to have a longer half-life than other anti-CD20 antibodies, which means that it can stay in the body longer and maintain its therapeutic effect. This may allow for less frequent dosing and more convenient administration.
 
Third, [GAZ]MabinoB is expected to have a synergistic effect with other immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate and corticosteroids. This may enhance the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy.

## What are the Risks and Side Effects of [GAZ]MabinoB?
 
As with any medication, [GAZ]MabinoB may cause some side effects and risks. The most common side effects of [GAZ]MabinoB are infusion-related reactions, such as fever, chills, headache, nausea, and rash. These usually occur during or shortly after the infusion and can be managed with premedication and supportive care.
 
The most serious risk of [GAZ]MabinoB is infection, especially viral infections such as hepatitis B and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). These infections can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Therefore, before starting [GAZ]MabinoB treatment, you should be tested for hepatitis B and monitored for signs and symptoms of infection during and after the treatment.
 
Other possible risks of [GAZ]MabinoB include low blood cell counts, allergic reactions, cardiac events, and malignancies. You should discuss these risks with your doctor and report any adverse events or changes in your health condition.
 
## How to Use [GAZ]MabinoB?
 
[GAZ]MabinoB is given as an intravenous infusion in a hospital or clinic setting. The dosage and frequency of [GAZ]MabinoB depend on your body weight, disease severity, and response to treatment. The typical dosage of [GAZ]MabinoB is 1000 mg per infusion, given every 6 months.
 
Before receiving [GAZ]MabinoB, you should take some medications to prevent or reduce infusion-related reactions. These may include antihistamines, corticosteroids, and acetaminophen. You should also drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol before and after the infusion.
 
During the infusion, you will be monitored by a nurse or a doctor for any signs of infusion-related reactions or other complications. The infusion may take 2 to 4 hours to complete. After the infusion, you should stay in the hospital or clinic for another hour for observation.
